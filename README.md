# DruML

DruML is an AI-powered electronic drum module that utilizes miniature quantized neural networks to predict drum strikes and generate MIDI signals with ultra-low latency. The project is designed to run on STM32 microcontrollers.

## Usage

DruML is designed to work seamlessly with any MIDI-compatible software or hardware. Once connected, it will automatically detect drum strikes and send the corresponding MIDI signals.
